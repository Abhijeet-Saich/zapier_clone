What job does ZAPIER does ?

create a ZAP 
You will get a link
Paste that link in Github
if any git-hub update
request send to Zapier from Github
we extract data from that request
Perform all the required action based on received data






//ARCHITECTURE

*request comes to Zapier
    --> store in db
    --> send it to kafka queue
    --> [How to make the above process atomic ?],to make sure EVENT reaches both DB and kafka-queue
    ##
    --> create a sweeper which check's if any event is "inActive" for 1 hour,
    --> sweeper pushes this event again in kafka-queue
    OR
    --> put request in DB in another table "trigger-outbox"
    --> use sweeper to pick "requests" from this table and send it to queue
    --> this is called "tranction" pattern,as ATOMICITY is default in DB






// DATABASE MODELS

zap --> Trigger (one to one)
zap --> actions (one to many)
trigger  --> available triggers (one to many)
action   --> available actions  (many to one)
